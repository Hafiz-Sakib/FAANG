/*
Sample 1.
Input:
1 0
Output:
Explanation:
If there are no packets, you shouldnâ€™t output anything.
9
Sample 2.
Input:
1 1
0 0
Output:
0
Explanation:
The only packet arrived at time 0, and computer started processing it immediately.
Sample 3.
Input:
1 2
0 1
0 1
Output:
0
-1
Explanation:
The first packet arrived at time 0, the second packet also arrived at time 0, but was dropped, because
the network buffer has size 1 and it was full with the first packet already. The first packet started
processing at time 0, and the second packet was not processed at all.
Sample 4.
Input:
1 2
0 1
1 1
Output:
0
1
Explanation:
The first packet arrived at time 0, the computer started processing it immediately and finished at time
1. The second packet arrived at time 1, and the computer started processing it immediately.
Sample 5:
Input:
1 1
1 0
Correct output:
1
Sample 6:
Input:
2 2
0 1
0 1
Output:
0
1
