/*
Nehal wants to make a special space for candies on his bookshelf.Currently, it has N books of different heights and unit width. 
Help him select 2 books such that he can store maximum candies between them by removing all the other books from between the selected books.
The task is to find out the area between 2 books that can hold the maximum candies without changing the original position of selected books. 
Example:
INPUT: N =3
       height[]={1,3,4}
OUTPUT:1
