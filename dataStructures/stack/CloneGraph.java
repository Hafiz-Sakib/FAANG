Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected problems.graph, return a deep copy (clone) of the problems.graph. Each node in the problems.graph contains a val (int) and a list (List[Node]) of its neighbors.
Example:
Input:
{"$id":"1","neighbors":[{"$id":"2","neighbors":[{"$ref":"1"},{"$id":"3","neighbors":[{"$ref":"2"},{"$id":"4","neighbors":[{"$ref":"3"},{"$ref":"1"}],"val":4}],"val":3}],"val":2},{"$ref":"4"}],"val":1}
Explanation:
Node 1's value is 1, and it has two neighbors: Node 2 and 4.
Node 2's value is 2, and it has two neighbors: Node 1 and 3.
Node 3's value is 3, and it has two neighbors: Node 2 and 4.
Node 4's value is 4, and it has two neighbors: Node 1 and 3.
Note:
The number of nodes will be between 1 and 100.
The undirected problems.graph is a simple problems.graph, which means no repeated edges and no self-loops in the problems.graph.
Since the problems.graph is undirected, if node p has node q as neighbor, then node q must have node p as neighbor too.
You must return the copy of the given node as a reference to the cloned problems.graph.
